## Background

IT Technician passionate about solving technical problems and exploring systems in depth. 
Graduated in Cyber Security, now actively building a hands-on portfolio while studying for Security+ and OSCP. 
I enjoy tackling complex challenges and applying practical solutions to real-world IT and security problems, becoming increasingly curious as I go along.

## Objective

I am passionate about security, both physical and cyber. My goal at the moment is to transition to a cyber security role.
I would love to learn penetration testing in depth, then put that knowledge to use in a Threat Intelligence or Threat Hunting role.
Currently also studying OT security, how industrial systems and cyber security meet, and where risks lie.
