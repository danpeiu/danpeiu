## Background

IT Technician passionate about solving technical problems and exploring systems in depth. 
Graduated in Cyber Security, now actively building a hands-on portfolio while studying for Security+ and HTB's CPTS. 
I enjoy tackling complex challenges and applying practical solutions to real-world IT and security problems, becoming increasingly curious as I go along.

## Objective

I focus on both physical and cyber security, with the goal of moving into a cyber security role. I am building expertise in penetration testing and exploring Operational Technology
(OT) security in my spare time to identify risks where industrial systems and cyber security intersect.
Hoping to ultimately work in a Threat Intelligence role.
