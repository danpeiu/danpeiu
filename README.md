I am an IT Technician who is driven to solve complex problems and dive deep into the technicals.
Graduate in Cyber Security, I am constantly adding to my portfolio, while studying for Security+ and OSCP.

## Objective
[Provide Objective - Remove this afterwards]]

I am passionate about security, both physical and cyber. My goal at the moment is to transition to a cyber security role.
I would love to learn penetration testing in depth, then put that knowledge to use in a Threat Intelligence or Threat Hunting role.
Currently also studying OT security, how industrial systems and cyber security meet, and where risks lie.
